Whenever possible, try to maintain the current coding style.

### Bug Fixes

For larger changes or if you’re uncertain, please open an issue or a draft pull request first to discuss your approach.

For major changes or enhancements, please open an issue or a draft pull request first so we can review your contribution.

### Tracking

If you want to add support for a new tracking site, you can refer to the existing implementations — [Anilist](https://github.com/ollm/OpenComic/blob/master/scripts/tracking/anilist/anilist.js) and [MyAnimeList](https://github.com/ollm/OpenComic/blob/master/scripts/tracking/myanimelist/myanimelist.js) — or use the [example implementation](https://github.com/ollm/OpenComic/blob/master/scripts/tracking/example/example.js) as a starting point.

Additionally, you'll need to update both [`tracking-sites.js`](https://github.com/ollm/OpenComic/blob/master/scripts/tracking/tracking-sites.js) and [`tracking-sites-keys.js`](https://github.com/ollm/OpenComic/blob/master/scripts/tracking/tracking-sites-keys.js) to include the new site's information.
